# 🚁 Drone's PID Control

- Project Duration : 2023.09 ~ 2023.12
- Proejct Description: Bio-Inspired Robot with Adaptive Morphological Changes
---

- Integrate a "Drone system" into the Folding Gear Modular Robot to create a drone robot capable of flying in situations with obstacles.
- --> Developing the drone’s PID control system by incorporating ultrasonic, pressure, and IMU sensors.
- Challenges Faced: While the drone control was successful, implementing a drone with sufficient output to handle the weight of the Folding Gear Modular Robot was difficult due to its heaviness.
